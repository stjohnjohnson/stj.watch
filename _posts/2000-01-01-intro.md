#### On **November 7th** I'll be running a gaming marathon to raise money for the [**UCSF Benioff Children's Hospitals**](https://give.ucsfbenioffchildrens.org) via Extra-Life. I will be streaming on Twitch for **24 hours straight** playing games with friends, family, and **YOU.**

#### Earlier in the year, I raised **$1,800** through local LAN parties.  Help me reach my **goal of $3,500** by clicking the [**donate button**](https://donate.cjx.watch/) above.

#### If you're unable to donate, feel free to [**watch my stream,**](https://stream.cjx.watch/) say hello, chat, and encourage me when I'm **_completely exhausted_** at the 23 hour mark.
