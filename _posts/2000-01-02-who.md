## Hey folks! I'm _**St. John**_ ([pronounced SinJin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_John_(name)))

#### For the past 20 years or so, I've been spending quality time with my friends playing video games at LAN parties!

#### Whether they were **24 hours long** or just till midnight, I loved hanging out with friends, gaming, and drinking some quality Mountain Dew _(hence the gamer tag **CaffeineJunkie**)_.

#### Even after I graduated, got a job, got married, had kids, **I still love to game.** So to this day, I continue to help organize and fund LAN parties at my office with my friends and co-workers.


#### Gaming and LAN parties are such an _important part of my life_ and have helped me grow into the person I am today.  By raising money for the [local Children's Hospitals](https://www.ucsfbenioffchildrens.org/), I'm hoping to give these kids an opportunity to discover their own passions.
